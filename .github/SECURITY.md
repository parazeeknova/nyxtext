# Reporting Security Issues

Welcome to **NyxText's** GitHub Security Policy! We take security as seriously as a *squirrel guarding its nuts*. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions, but that doesn't mean we can't have a little fun along the way.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/parazeeknova/nyxtext/security/advisories/new) tab.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

If you stumble upon a bug, don't panic! Bugs are just features in disguise, waiting to be discovered. Let us know, and we'll squash them faster than Mario stomping on Goombas.
Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the ["Issues"](https://github.com/parazeeknova/nyxtext/issues/new) tab.

***With great power comes great responsibility. We give you more control than Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet, but don't abuse it.***
